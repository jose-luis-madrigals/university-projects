Here you can see my projects in many programming languages, but I will only show some pdf with screenshots of the results and short descriptions, this is because these are academic works, so avoiding plagiarism is critical. But if you would like to analize and try the codes, please let me know and I can give you the access to my private repository where you can find the files. I translated most of the information into english in case there are people from other countries who want to understand the design, implementation and results of the codes. In case it was not an individual work, I included in each document the name of my colleagues to give them credit as well.

## High School

I included some of my first projects (their reports).
1. Python / soccer concept video game on PyGame.
2. Python / analysis of Twitter information with developer account.
3. Arduino / prototype of a strongbox with components.

## Career

## 1st Semester

1. Python: data analysis of COVID Mexico files.
2. Python: statistics and linear regression with basic machine learning for a food register file.
3. C++: basic algorithm for E-business based on Object-oriented programming.
4. MATLAB: simulation of events related to physics and mathematics, volcano launch and roller coaster trip.

## 2nd Semester

QUANTUM HackMx: I included the presentation of my first Hackathon in a different folder, this was in April 2021 and my team and I won the first place. We took the NDS Cognitive Labs challenge, where we had to detect bank fraud with machine learning, besides we were the best project for NDS, we had an honorable mention from Wolfram.
1. MATLAB: edge detection algorithms on images.
2. MATLAB: 2D simulation of electric fields of parallel plates and 3D simulation of electromagnetic fields of four figures with animation of particle trajectory in it.
3. R: biological analysis with dataset from GEO and bioinformatic resources.
5. C++: basic algorithm for Streaming service based on Object-oriented programming.

## 3rd Semester

1. C++: implementation of data structures to understand botnet presence in network accesses.
2. Assembler (MARIE Simulator): program to store measurements in memory that takes as reference a sensor that delivers a reading.
3. Arduino / SQL / PHP: temperature_humidity and co2 sensor readings monitoring station for IoT.

## 4th Semester
1. C# / SQL / Typescript / PHP / 2D: video game in Unity based on percussions that is connected by APIs to a database that leads to a data warehouse that is used for the generation of statistics shown in a web page for decision making. |Training Partner: Percussive Arts Society|
2. Clojure: simulation of an assembler based on operations defined by opcodes.
3. Packet Tracer: network proposal for ICPC event based on subnetting and basic protocols. |Training Partner: Tec de Monterrey and Cisco|

## 5th Semester
1. Kotlin / PHP / SQL: event alerts mobile application in Android Studio that obtains information from a database that receives the records of a web page for administrators. |Training Partner: Municipality of Atizapan|
2. Python: strategic player for Caterpillars' game of Dagor framework that uses minimax function.
3. Python / C#: multi-agent system with Mesa library based on efficient synchronization of vehicular traffic that is simulated in a 3D project of Unity.

## 6th Semester
Javascript / Typescript / Python: Web page for the sale of new and used cars from agencies, where many functionalities are offered for various roles such as super administrator, automotive group administrator, manager, seller and buyer. It was a group project of 25 people, so we not only put into practice technical skills, but we also learned a lot about project management and value contribution. |Training Partner: NDS Cognitive Labs|
