Here you can see the codes and files used for my projects, please remember these are academic works and respect the intellectual property. You should also consider that in some of these projects you will need a specific software version, a type of hardware, installed libraries, licenses or aditional tools such as databases or APIs, so considering that over time the projects became more complex, it may be possible that in some cases you can only check partial functionality but I included most of the files used in each folder.
